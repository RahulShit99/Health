				<h3>Carbohydrate</h3>
				<img src="images2/brownrice.jpg" alt="Brown Rice">
				<p>Brown rice is naturally gluten-free, making it a good option for older adults with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
	                Brown rice has a low glycemic index, meaning it does not cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels. 
	                This is important for older adults with diabetes or who are at risk for developing diabetes.

				<h3>Protein</h3>
				<img src="images2/ckfe.jpg" alt="Chicken-Fish-Egg">
				<p>Chicken, fish, and eggs are all excellent sources of protein, 
	                which is important for people of all ages, especially older adults.
	                As we age, our muscles naturally weaken, which can lead to frailty and other health problems. Consuming adequate amounts of protein, 
	                such as those found in chicken, fish, and eggs, can help maintain muscle mass and prevent muscle loss.</p>

				<h3>Fiber</h3>
				<img src="images2/fv.jpg" alt="Fruit and Vegetables">
				<p>Fruits and vegetables are important for people of all ages, but they become particularly important for older adults. 
	                Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber, 
	                which can help regulate digestion and prevent constipation. This is especially important for older adults, 
	                who may be more prone to digestive issues.

				<h3>Fluid</h3>
				<img src="images2/water.jpg" alt="Water">
				<p>Drinking water is essential for everyone, but it becomes particularly important for older adults
	                As we age, our bodies become less efficient at conserving water, and our sense of thirst can also decrease. This puts older adults at a higher risk of dehydration, which can lead to a range of health problems, 
	                including dizziness, confusion, and even urinary tract infections
	            </p>

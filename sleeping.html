		<p> Adequate sleep is associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. It also helps to boost the immune system, which is important for fighting off infections. Sleep is crucial for maintaining cognitive function, including memory and attention. Older adults who get enough sleep are better able to focus and remember information, which is important for maintaining independence and quality of life. Sleep is also important for emotional well-being. Older adults who get enough sleep are less likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety. Adequate sleep is important for maintaining safety, particularly for older adults who may be at a higher risk of falls and accidents. Poor sleep quality can lead to daytime sleepiness, which can increase the risk of falls and other accidents. Finally, getting enough sleep is important for overall quality of life. Older adults who get enough sleep are more likely to have better physical and cognitive function, better emotional well-being, and a better overall quality of life.</p>
